Our Tetris game is a single player game where the computer randomly generates tetromino blocks (in the shapes of square, J, L, Z, S, I) that the user can rotate using their upward key. Tetrominoes can be stacked to create lines to be cleared by the computer and be counted as points that will be tracked. Once a tetromino passes the boundary of the screen the user will lose.
