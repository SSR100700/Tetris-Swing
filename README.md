>Here in this project we used AWT and swing to develop window based application in java. Mainly whole project is divided into 4 modules named as “Tetris.java”, “TetrisApp.java”, “BlockV6.java”, “Blockv4.java”.
<br></br>
Our Tetris game is a single player game where the computer randomly generates tetromino blocks (in the shapes of square, J, L, Z, S, I) that the user can rotate using their upward key. Tetrominoes can be stacked to create lines to be cleared by the computer and be counted as points that will be tracked. Once a tetromino passes the boundary of the screen the user will lose.

<br></br>
### This version have two types of mode V4 and V6 indicating the number of Blocks a tetrominoes have.
